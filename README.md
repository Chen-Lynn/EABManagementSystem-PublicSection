# EABManagementSystem-PublicSection
A Java app is built to give prompt treatment alternatives on EAB management. It is developed in Java and MS Access, and all data source will be imported from MS Excel. 
Background:

The Emerald Ash Borer(EAB) is considered to be one of the worst invasive pests in North Americ, and is causing serious damage to ash trees in Ontario. The EAB infestation in Southern Ontario is Expanding at a rate that is difficult to control given our current resources, and the insect's cryptic nature makes it difficult to detect. Rapid tree mortality rates mean that there are often significant losses before any actions can proceed. This is a challenge to forestry forfessionals and municipalities charged with the management of publicly owned ash trees and th public goods and services these trees provide. In order to del with EAB in the ST. George campus, and EAB Mangement Model was developed through a collaboration between the Faculty of Forestry and University of Toronto Facilities and services department, using the Neighboutwoods protocl.the goal of this model is to suggest best management practices for local ash trees.

Introduction to the software:

The development of EAB Management System application aims at building a portable application and giving prompt treatment alternatives on EAB management. This application is developed in Java and MS Access. Java is used to develop graphical user interface, whereas Access is to store and manage the input data and analysis results. It mainly consists of six modules:
•	Data Input
•	Parameters setting 
•	Data Analysis
•	Results output
•	Data Search
•	Help
The original data of the EAB system can be imported from MS Excel, which makes users more comfortable to organize the input data.   The system will automatically evaluate the input data and correct the data types if the data type from Excel file differs from what is needed in EAB system. Meanwhile, the system is not case-insensitive so that users do not need to care of uppercase or lowercase during the data input.  The parameters are preset default values already in this system. However, users can reset parameters’ values and trees’ treatments. Based on the input data and specified parameters, the application calculates and analyzes data.  There are 6 analysis units, which are Health Analysis, Emerald ash border Analysis, Value analysis, Risk analysis, Tree analysis and Economic Analysis. All analysis results are stored in the system after analysis to facilitate users to access to them. The search module helps users to find the data of one or more specified trees, including the original data, analysis results and the economic costs from the application. During the process of data analysis, users can easily export or print analysis results by clicking on the corresponding buttons. Moreover, the chart function displays analysis results in a more intuitive way. The help module introduces how to install and use the EAB application. Meanwhile, it lists contact information and links to related websites in case the users need more help.
. The EAB management system is portable and can be easily installed on different computers. Due to its friendly graphic user interface, the application can provide useful information to residents, communities, or parks, and help them to make better decision regarding EAB management. It is a time-saving and economical program to treat EAB.
